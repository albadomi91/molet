This is a collection of software creating simulated galaxy-galaxy lenses as a function of time.
This relates to existing point-like and variable objects within the source galaxy, such as an Active Galactic Nucleus or Supernova.



# Files
The files included are as follows:


**input_example.json:**
is an example of the input file that will be run by the code. It includes many options, such as the mass model for the lens, the source, profile, its variability etc.

**input_example_instructions.txt:**
describes the various input parameters appearing in the previous file.

**input_different_options:**
lists all the possible groups of paramaters (.json objects) that can go in the input file, along with a description.

**workflow.odg:**
is a schematic diagram of the workflow and interaction of the different codes/data.
