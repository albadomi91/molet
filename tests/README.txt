Several examples are provided bla bla bla.
Here is the summary of all the examples included:

"test_0"  -  A basic test for an AGN point source
"test_1"  -  Same as "test_0", but having two variable signals intrinsic to the source.
             One is microlensed (coming from a small enough area) and another that is not (coming from a large area, e.g. the BELR).
